    - Example of multiple pad mounted single phase transformers connected to three phase underground cable lines.
    - Maintains correct conductor detail information in the related ElectricWireData table
    - Elbows on either side of the transformer, alowing any one of them to be opened indenpendtly of the other
    - Supports historical view of device status from systems such as SCADA
    - Better support for offline use of data
    - Better support for OMS and ADMS by simplying the data extract process
    - Improved phase managment of wire data to allow less costly support for engineering analysis
