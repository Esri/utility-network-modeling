    - Example of a Pad Mounted Switchgear or Cabinet.  This model uses two sets of switches and two sets of fuses, Model PME9 or PMH9 from S&C
    - Demonstrates use of single phase lines exiting the cabinet on the fused side, which is a common practise for many customers.
  - Advantages
    - Supports Phase Management of unbalanced three phase systems
    - Supports operational state view of system, with use of override tables
    - Better support for offline use of data
    - Better support for OMS and ADMS by simplying the data extract process as every device used in switching orders is present, allowing for quick and simple creation of switching orders, either directly from ArcGIS Services or from an Outage Management System
    - Improved phase managment of wire data to allow less costly support for engineering analysis
