    - Example of Three Phase configuration of a Fused Tap
    - Tap features are required for each phase, both on the tapped line and the tapping line to allow for more accurate tracking of phase details of devices and electric conductors.
  - Advantages
    - Supports Phase Management of unbalanced three phase systems
    - Eliminates use of complex related tables
    - Supports operational state view of system, with use of override tables
    - Better support for offline use of data
    - Better support for OMS and ADMS by simplying the data extract process
    - Improved phase managment of wire data to allow less costly support for engineering analysis
