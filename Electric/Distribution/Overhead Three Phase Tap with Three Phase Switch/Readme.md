    - Example of Three Phase line being tapped by a three phase line using a single gang operated switch to isolate the tap
    - It is assumed this device cannot be operated by phase and that the device status will be the same for all three phases at all times
  - Advantages
    - Supports Phase Management of balanced or unbalanced three phase systems
    - Eliminates use of complex related tables for devices, improving overall performance and conflict reduction
    - Supports multiple state view of the system
    - Supports historical view of device status from systems such as SCADA
    - Better support for offline use of data
    - Better support for OMS and ADMS by simplying the data extract process
    - Improved phase managment of wire data to allow less costly support for engineering analysis
