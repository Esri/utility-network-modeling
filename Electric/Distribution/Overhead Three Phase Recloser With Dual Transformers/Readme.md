## GN Configuration Info
  - Notes
    Example of a Overhead Three Phase Recloser.  This diagram shows examples of optional configurations, such as Dual Transformers used for device operation.
##UN Detail Configuration Info
  - Notes
  - Advantages
    - Demonstrates single phase devices that support phase operability
    - Maintains correct phase association from Taps, alowing phase changes to be propagated correctly
    - Demonstrates content capabilites, using an assemlby to contain the indivual equipment
    - Domonstrtes high level of detail to more acturally model the operational view of information
