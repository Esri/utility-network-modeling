    - Example of Overhead Single Phase Transformer providing service to two residences. 
    - Demonstrates
      - Connectivity to midpoint on low voltage line and using a connectivity association from the Low Side terminal of the transformer to the low voltage line
      - Structural attachment of low voltage line to medium voltage structure
      - Service Point connectivity association to a tap on the low voltage line, avoiding spliting of line
      - Overhead transformer high side termnal connectivity to medium voltage overhead cable using a connecivity association to a tap, avoiding spliting of overhead medium voltage line
  - Advantages
    - Supports Phase Management of Overhead transformer 
    - Eliminates use of complex related tables
    - Supports operational state view of system, with use of override tables
    - Better support for offline use of data
    - Better support for OMS and ADMS by simplying the data extract process
    - Improved phase managment of wire data to allow less costly support for engineering analysis 
    - Reduction in number of lines stored in system by avoiding unnecessary line splits for connectivity
