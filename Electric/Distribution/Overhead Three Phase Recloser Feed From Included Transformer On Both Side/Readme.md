    - Demonstrates the correct use of Taps as single phases features
    - Demonstrates a device (recloser) that is probably actually one physical device, but needs to be modeled as three seperate device features to allow for individual phase management either from a Normal state perspective or from an Operational state perspective and also allow the use of "Status Override" which can be used to view historical states of the phases of devices from foreign systems, like OMS or SCADA
    - Deomonstrates use of strutural attachement
      - Pole is assocated to assembly
